# FakeGradient
This is the repo for our paper "Fake Gradient: A Security and Privacy Protection Framework for DNN-based Image Classification"



This folder contains the source code for our Fake Gradient:

Experiment Environment:
This code is developed with Python 3.7 Pytorch 1.0 and OpenCV4.0
The DNN models used here are from the torchvision libraries.

The files are organized as below:

Fake Gradient:

	|

	|

	|---------ModelModify.py: contains the core functions that modify the model

	|

	|---------DeepFoolB.py: the original code of Deepfool

	|

	|---------DeepFoolC.py: the original code of Deepfool with minor modification for   

 	|	displaying the parameters of the modified model

	|

	|---------HeatMapShow.py: contains functions to process and visualize the
    	gradient/perturbation

	|

	|---------AnalysisWeight.py: Code to analyze the weights of fully connected layer

	|

	|---------MM21_classifiactionResult.py: The code to analyze the overhead

	|

	|

	|---------MM21_FakeGradient_DeepFool_XXXX.py: The code to analyze defense
     
    |	accuracy based on Model XXXX
